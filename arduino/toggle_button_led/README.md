# Toggle LED with Push Button (Arduino)

This project toggles an LED on and off each time a button is pressed.

---

## ðŸ§  What It Does
- Reads input from a push button connected to digital pin 7  
- Toggles an LED connected to digital pin 8  
- Stores LED state in a variable (`ledState`)  
- Tracks button state change (LOW â†’ HIGH) using `lastButtonState`  
- Adds basic debounce using `delay(50)`
---


## âš¡ Circuit Diagram

- LED anode â†’ Pin 8  
- LED cathode â†’ 220Î© resistor â†’ GND  
- Push button one leg â†’ +5V  
- Other leg â†’ Pin 7  
- 10KÎ© resistor between Pin 7 and GND (pull-down)

+5V ---- Button ---- Pin 7
|
[10KÎ©]
|
GND

Pin 8 ----> [220Î©] ----> LED ----> GND

## ðŸ”§ Code Snippet

```cpp
if (lastButtonState == LOW && buttonState == HIGH) {
  ledState = !ledState;
  digitalWrite(ledPin, ledState);
  delay(50); // debounce
}
```

## ðŸ§ª Tested On

- Arduino Uno R3

- Standard push button

- Basic breadboard setup

### ðŸ’¡ Notes

You can replace INPUT + external pull-down with INPUT_PULLUP and invert the logic.

Replace delay() with millis() for non-blocking debounce in advanced projects.
